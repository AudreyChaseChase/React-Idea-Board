# Developer Comments

### Objective achieved
* Implemented required features
* Implemented stretch features
* Applied Ducks file structure to orgranize React/Redux architecture

### Potential Improvement
* Test Coverage: Lack of unit tests for async action creaters and some components
* Time management: Required features was done in 3 hours by using component states, but I thought it would be a good challenge to write  Redux and its unit test, which took more time than the estimation.
